Robux, derived from the words "Roblox" and "bucks," was introduced to the Roblox community on May 14th, 2007. Originally, Roblox used a different currency called "Roblox Points" or "R$." However, due to the need for a more intuitive, versatile, and universally recognizable currency, Robux was born.
